# Sum The Strings
Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):
Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)

Notes:
If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.
Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)
